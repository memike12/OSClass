The coconuts, machetes and funnels were getting used and released but the islanders were never telling each other that any where availiable. There was a while loop that said if there aren't any availiable, keep looping. This was the deadlock. The islanders waiting weren't notified that the other islanders were done so they would just wait infinatly. I solved this by using semaphores to prevent the deadlock.
